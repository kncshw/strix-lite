    <description>Complete the security scan and generate final report.

This tool MUST be called at the very end of the security assessment to:
- Generate the final comprehensive scan report
- Mark the entire scan as completed
- Stop the agent from running

Use this tool when:
- You have completed all testing phases
- You are ready to conclude the entire security assessment

IMPORTANT: Calling this tool multiple times will OVERWRITE any previous scan report.

Put ALL details in the content - methodology, tools used, vulnerability counts, key findings, recommendations,
compliance notes, risk assessments, next steps, etc. Be comprehensive and include everything relevant.</description>
