  <tool name="web_search">
    <description>Search the web using Firecrawl and AI synthesis for real-time information.

This is your PRIMARY research tool. It performs a live search, scrapes the most relevant pages, and synthesizes the findings to answer your question. Use it for:
- Current vulnerabilities, CVEs, and security advisories
- Latest attack techniques, exploits, and proof-of-concepts
- Technology-specific documentation and configuration
- Target reconnaissance and OSINT
- Finding specific tools or libraries

The tool gathers raw content from the web and processes it to give you a highly technical, verified answer.</description>
    <details>This tool leverages Firecrawl to perform deep searches and retrieve full page content (Markdown), which is then analyzed by a Large Language Model to provide a precise answer. It is superior to standard search because it reads the actual documentation/articles rather than just snippets.</details>
